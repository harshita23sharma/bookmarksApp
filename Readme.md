The goal of this app is to manage bookmarks.

So we’ll need to create our Bookmark resource.
We’ve generated a scaffold that creates all the necessary files and code to automatically get a full MVC stack that manages a Bookmark. 
Scaffolding is a technique supported by some model–view–controller frameworks, in which the programmer can specify how the application database may be used. The compiler or framework uses this specification, together with pre-defined code templates, to generate the final code that the application can use to create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the templates as a "scaffold" on which to build a more powerful application.
